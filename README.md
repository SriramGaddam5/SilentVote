## About

### Inspiration

We were inspired by the recent 2024 and 2020 presidential elections where candidates were accusing different parties of election fraud. A platform supporting zero knowledge architecture solves this problem because election results can be transparent and trustworthy while maintaining privacy and security. Voting systems like this can also be used in professional business or school club environments where conflicts of interest made be present and voters wish to stay anonymous.

### What it does

The working idea of SilentVote is that election results can be transparent while still maintaining anonymity of voters by aggregating votes without connecting votes to respective voters by utilizing Zero Knowledge Proofs.

### How we built it

SilentVote is a Decentralized Application built on the Midnight blockchain with zk-SNARKS, a non-interactive proof system.

### Challenges we ran into

The main challenge of this project was setting up the Midnight testnet and generating correct proofs and verifying them.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to create a functional PoC voting platform that supports different blockchain operations on both the shielded and unshielded ledger.

### What's next for Silent Vote

We hope that this project inspires future collaborations between cryptographers and web3 developers to create a fully established ecosystem of anonymous voting systems.
